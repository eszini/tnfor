We have made progress in the classification.
So far, in the main codebase, we have:

sl: allocate is on a single line.
ml: allocate spans multiple lines.
sv: allocate has a single variable.
mv: allocate has more than one variable.
stat: The allocate statement already includes stat=.

Files with .for extension
sl sv: 687
stat: 2
sl mv: 2
ml sv: 148
ml mv: 51

Files with .f90 extension
sl sv: 1273
stat: 122
sl mv: 9
ml sv: 217
ml mv: 142
Total sum: 2,653


Next steps
I still need to work a bit more to identify the impact of "IF" in each allocate,
and start testing with some source files.
